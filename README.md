# Cinema Project

**Introduction**

The objective of this project was to create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. The technological tools used for creating this IMS project were:

•	Version Control System: Git

•	Source Code Management: GitHub

•	Kanban Board: Jira

•	Database Management System: MySQL Server 5.7+ (local or GCP instance)

•	Back-End Programming Language: Java - Using Spring Boot

•	Build Tool: Maven

•	Unit Testing: JUnit

•	Integration Tests: MockMVC

•	Front-End: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Project Plan

Using the project specifications document, I created a Jira Scrum Board to plan my project. I started off by creating separate epics for the Front-End, Back-End and Documentation for this project. The Jira Board can be viewed here:

## Version Control

For my Version Control, I used Git. I started off by making two respositories, one for the Front-End Respository and one for the Back-End Repository. Within these Reposotiories, I created a dev branches (which branches off the main branch) and also created a feature branches (which branches off the dev branch) for each function. 

## Database 

For this project, there were two databases that were required: MySQL and H2. MySQL was used to store the data from the applications, such as the data sent from the browser and from postman. H2 Console was used to test the Back-End application.
